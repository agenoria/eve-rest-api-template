# Foundation for Python API's Using Eve

This is a simple foundation for building API's using [Eve](http://python-eve.org/).

`setup.sh` contains basic instructions for setting up mongo (as the backend for the API) and redis (to allow rate-limiting on the API). This script may not be complete and may not work for you (I primarily intend this as a guideline to memorialize some of the tips and tricks I learned while setting up an API).

The setup for the API itself is based on the [Eve quickstart](http://python-eve.org/quickstart.html).
